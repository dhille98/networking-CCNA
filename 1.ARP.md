# Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a  protocol used to learn the hardware (MAC/Physical ) address of a machine/device/node  from an  given IP address. It is mainly  used when a device wants to communicate with other device on a local network (for example on an Ethernet network that requires physical addresses to be known before sending packets). 
Note that   1. ARP process will be completed first - 2. MAC-address table is update din the switch 

* **ARP Table:** 
    * it maps IP addresses to MAC addresses this table is used by Layer 3 devices (like routers) to a Layer 2 address(MAC ADDRESS) for packet encapsulation 
* **MAC Address Table:** it maps MAC address to switch parts. this table is used by Layer 2 devices (like switches) to determine which port to forword frames to based on the destination MAC address it does not deal with IP addresses  

* to reslove to IP to MAC addresses using on ARP


* What is Broadcasting 
    * on pc-a forword to packets pc-d but switch forword to all pc's 
    * using on we don't know destinations addresses 
    * one to all 
* what is uniqucasting
    * one to one  

* **show the MAC addresses table**
```
switch# sh mac address-table

# information about pc
ipconfig /all
arp -a

# send the arp request 
switch# sh mac address-table 

# router using command 
route# sh ip-arp 
# deleting the arp table using 
arp -d # using on pc
```
